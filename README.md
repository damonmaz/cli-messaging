# CLI Chatroom

## Overview
A chatroom application where clients can connect to a server and chat with each other.

I made this as a side-project to practice using TCP sockets and threading (and also general fun and enjoyment ðŸ˜Š)

## Implementation Details
- Uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) sockets for communication between server and clients
- Implements threading for concurrent sending and receiving of messages
- Includes a profanity filters and checks to make sure messages and usernames meet packet size requirements

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- colorama module
```
pip install colorama
```
- filter-profanity module
```
pip install filter-profanity
```

## Usage

### Change Parameters
Parameters of the server and client, such as the name of the server, the server IP address or server port number, can be changed in parameters.py
(defaults to localhost)

### Run the Program
In the command line interface, one instance of the server should be run and many clients can be run.

Change the active directory to src directory (C:\path\to\this\dir\src)

Run server:

```
python server_main.py
```

Run client(s):

```
python client_main.py
```
